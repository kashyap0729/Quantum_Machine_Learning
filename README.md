# Qiskit Machine Learning - Torch Connector Tutorial

## Overview
This repository hosts the tutorial for the Torch Connector within the Qiskit Machine Learning library. The Torch Connector allows for seamless integration between quantum computing algorithms provided by Qiskit and classical neural network models built with PyTorch. This tutorial provides an in-depth guide on how to enhance machine learning models with quantum computing layers using the Torch Connector.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin with this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.8 or newer
- PyTorch 1.9 or newer
- Qiskit 0.34 or newer
- Qiskit Machine Learning
- Streamlit
- scipy>=1.4
- numpy>=1.17
- psutil>=5

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
To get started with the tutorial, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quantum_Machine_Learning.git
cd Quantum_Machine_Learning
```

## Usage
Navigate to the tutorial notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook QuantumNeuralNetwork.ipynb
```
Running the Streamlit App
To view and interact with the Streamlit web application, run the following command from the root directory of the repository:

```bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
```
This will start the Streamlit server, and you should see a URL displayed in your terminal, which you can visit in your browser to interact with the application.
This Jupyter notebook includes step-by-step instructions on how to integrate quantum circuits into classical neural networks using the Torch Connector. It covers:
- Setting up necessary imports and configurations.
- Creating quantum circuits as neural network layers.
- Integrating these layers into PyTorch models.
- Training and evaluating the hybrid quantum-classical models.
